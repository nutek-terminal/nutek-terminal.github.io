## Description

Nikto is an Open Source (GPL) web server scanner which performs comprehensive tests against web servers for multiple items, including over 6700 potentially dangerous files/programs, checks for outdated versions of over 1250 servers, and version specific problems on over 270 servers. It also checks for server configuration items such as the presence of multiple index files, HTTP server options, and will attempt to identify installed web servers and software. Nikto has been used to find hundreds of web server problems, including missing patches, mis-configurations and default installs.

Nikto is an Open Source (GPL) web server scanner which performs comprehensive tests against web servers for multiple items, including over 6700 potentially dangerous files/programs, checks for outdated versions of over 1250 servers, and version specific problems on over 270 servers. It also checks for server configuration items such as the presence of multiple index files, HTTP server options, and will attempt to identify installed web servers and software. Scan items and plugins are frequently updated and can be automatically updated.

Nikto is not designed as a stealthy tool. It will test a web server in the quickest time possible, and is obvious in log files or to an IPS/IDS. However, there is support for LibWhisker's anti-IDS methods in case you want to give it a try (or test your IDS system).


Not every check is a security problem, though most are. There are some items that are "info only" type checks that look for things that may not have a security flaw, but the webmaster or security engineer may not know are present on the server. These items are usually marked appropriately in the information printed. There are also some checks for unknown items which have been seen scanned for in log files.

Features
* Here are some of the major features of Nikto. See the documentation for a full list of features and how to use them.
* SSL Support (Unix with OpenSSL or maybe Windows with ActiveState's
* Perl/NetSSL)
* Full HTTP proxy support
* Checks for outdated server components
* Save reports in plain text, XML, HTML, NBE or CSV
* Template engine to easily customize reports
* Scan multiple ports on a server, or multiple servers via input file (including nmap output)
* LibWhisker's IDS encoding techniques
* Easily updated via command line
* Identifies installed software via headers, favicons and files
* Host authentication with Basic and NTLM
* Subdomain guessing
* Apache and cgiwrap username enumeration
* Mutation techniques to "fish" for content on web servers
* Scan tuning to include or exclude entire classes of vulnerability checks
* Guess credentials for authorization realms (including many default id/pw combos)
* Authorization guessing handles any directory, not just the root directory
* Enhanced false positive reduction via multiple methods: headers, page content, and content hashing
* Reports "unusual" headers seen
* Interactive status, pause and changes to verbosity settings
* Save full request/response for positive tests
* Replay saved positive requests
* Maximum execution time per target
* Auto-pause at a specified time
* Checks for common "parking" sites

NAME
       nikto - Scan web server for known vulnerabilities

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/local/bin/nikto [options...]

DESCRIPTION
       Examine a web server to find potential problems and security vulnerabilities, including:

       •   Server and software misconfigurations

       •   Default files and programs

       •   Insecure files and programs

       •   Outdated servers and programs

       Nikto is built on LibWhisker (by RFP) and can run on any platform which has a Perl environment. It supports SSL, proxies, host authentication, IDS evasion and more. It can be updated
       automatically from the command-line, and supports the optional submission of updated version data back to the maintainers.

OPTIONS
       Below are all of the Nikto command line options and explanations. A brief version of this text is available by running Nikto with the -h (-help) option.

       -Cgidirs
	   Scan these CGI directories. Special words "none" or "all" may be used to scan all CGI directories or none, (respectively). A literal value for a CGI directory such as "/cgi-test/" may be
	   specified (must include trailing slash). If this is option is not specified, all CGI directories listed in config.txt will be tested.

       -config
	   Specify an alternative config file to use instead of the config.txt located in the install directory.

       -dbcheck
	   Check the scan databases for syntax errors.

       -Display
	   Control the output that Nikto shows. See Chapter 5 for detailed information on these options. Use the reference number or letter to specify the type, multiple may be used:

	   1 - Show redirects

	   2 - Show cookies received

	   3 - Show all 200/OK responses

	   4 - Show URLs which require authentication

	   D - Debug Output

	   V - Verbose Output

       -evasion
	   Specify the LibWhisker IDS evasion technique to use (see the LibWhisker docs for detailed information on these). Use the reference number to specify the type, multiple may be used:

	   1 - Random URI encoding (non-UTF8)

	   2 - Directory self-reference (/./)

	   3 - Premature URL ending

	   4 - Prepend long random string

	   5 - Fake parameter

	   6 - TAB as request spacer

	   7 - Change the case of the URL

	   8 - Use Windows directory separator (\)

       -findonly
	   Only discover the HTTP(S) ports, do not perform a security scan. This will attempt to connect with HTTP or HTTPS, and report the Server header.

       -Format
	   Save the output file specified with -o (-output) option in this format. If not specified, the default will be taken from the file extension specified in the -output option. Valid formats
	   are:

	   csv - a comma-seperated list

	   htm - an HTML report

	   txt - a text report

	   xml - an XML report

       -host
	   Host(s) to target. Can be an IP address, hostname or text file of hosts. A single dash (-) maybe used for stdout. Can also parse nmap -oG style output

       -Help
	   Display extended help information.

       -id
	   ID and password to use for host Basic host authentication. Format is "id:password".

       -list-plugins
	   Will list all plugins that Nikto can run against targets and then will exit without performing a scan. These can be tuned for a session using the -plugins option.

	   The output format is:

	   Plugin name

	    full name - description

	    Written by author, Copyright (C) copyright

       -mutate
	   Specify mutation technique. A mutation will cause Nikto to combine tests or attempt to guess values. These techniques may cause a tremendous amount of tests to be launched against the
	   target. Use the reference number to specify the type, multiple may be used:

	   1 - Test all files with all root directories

	   2 - Guess for password file names

	   3 - Enumerate user names via Apache (/~user type requests)

	   4 - Enumerate user names via cgiwrap (/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/~user type requests)

	   5 - Attempt to brute force sub-domain names, assume that the host name is the parent domain

	   6 - Attempt to guess directory names from the supplied dictionary file

       -mutate-options
	   Provide extra information for mutates, e.g. a dictionary file

       -nolookup
	   Do not perform name lookups on IP addresses.

       -nossl
	   Do not use SSL to connect to the server.

       -no404
	   Disable 404 (file not found) checking. This will reduce the total number of requests made to the webserver and may be preferable when checking a server over a slow link, or an embedded
	   device. This will generally lead to more false positives being discovered.

       -output
	   Write output to the file specified. The format used will be taken from the file extension. This can be over-riden by using the -Format option (e.g. to write text files with a different
	   extenstion. Existing files will have new information appended.

       -plugins
	   Select which plugins will be run on the specified targets. A comma separated list should be provided which lists the names of the plugins. The names can be found by using -list-plugins.

	   There are two special entries: ALL, which specifies all plugins shall be run and NONE, which specifies no plugins shall be run. The default is ALL

       -port
	   TCP port(s) to target. To test more than one port on the same host, specify the list of ports in the -p (-port) option. Ports can be specified as a range (i.e., 80-90), or as a
	   comma-delimited list, (i.e., 80,88,90). If not specified, port 80 is used.

       -Pause
	   Seconds to delay between each test.

       -root
	   Prepend the value specified to the beginning of every request. This is useful to test applications or web servers which have all of their files under a certain directory.

       -ssl
	   Only test SSL on the ports specified. Using this option will dramatically speed up requests to HTTPS ports, since otherwise the HTTP request will have to timeout first.

       -Single
	   Perform a single request to a target server. Nikto will prompt for all options which can be specified, and then report the detailed output. See Chapter 5 for detailed information.

       -timeout
	   Seconds to wait before timing out a request. Default timeout is 10 seconds.

       -Tuning
	   Tuning options will control the test that Nikto will use against a target. By default, if any options are specified, only those tests will be performed. If the "x" option is used, it will
	   reverse the logic and exclude only those tests. Use the reference number or letter to specify the type, multiple may be used:

	   0 - File Upload

	   1 - Interesting File / Seen in logs

	   2 - Misconfiguration / Default File

	   3 - Information Disclosure

	   4 - Injection (XSS/Script/HTML)

	   5 - Remote File Retrieval - Inside Web Root

	   6 - Denial of Service

	   7 - Remote File Retrieval - Server Wide

	   8 - Command Execution / Remote Shell

	   9 - SQL Injection

	   a - Authentication Bypass

	   b - Software Identification

	   c - Remote Source Inclusion

	   x - Reverse Tuning Options (i.e., include all except specified)

	   The given string will be parsed from left to right, any x characters will apply to all characters to the right of the character.

       -useproxy
	   Use the HTTP proxy defined in the configuration file.

       -update
	   Update the plugins and databases directly from cirt.net.

       -Version
	   Display the Nikto software, plugin and database versions.

       -vhost
	   Specify the Host header to be sent to the target.

FILES
       nikto.conf
	   The Nikto configuration file. This sets Nikto´s global options. Several nikto.conf files may exist and are parsed in the below order. As each configuration file is loaded is supersedes any
	   previously set configuration:

	   •   System wide (e.g. /etc/nikto.conf)

	   •   Home directory (e.g. $HOME/nikto.conf)

	   •   Current directory (e.g. ./nikto.conf)

       ${NIKTO_DIR}/plugins/db*
	   db files are the databases that nikto uses to check for vulnerabilities and issues within the web server.

       ${NIKTO_DIR}/plugins/*.plugin
	   All nikto´s plugins exist here. Nikto itself is just a wrapper script to manage CLI and pass through to the plugins.

       ${NIKTO_DIR}/templates
	   Contains the templates for nikto´s output formats.

BUGS
       The current features are not supported:

       •   SOCKS Proxies
