## Description

Argon2 is a password-hashing function that summarizes the state of the art in the design of memory-hard functions and can be used to hash passwords for credential storage, key derivation, or other applications.

## Installation

```bash
brew install argon2
```

## Usage

```bash
echo -n "password" | argon2 somesalt -t 2 -m 16 -p 4 -l 24
```

```text
Usage:  argon2 [-h] salt [-i|-d|-id] [-t iterations] [-m log2(memory in KiB) | -k memory in KiB] [-p parallelism] [-l hash length] [-e|-r] [-v (10|13)]
    Password is read from stdin
Parameters:
    salt        The salt to use, at least 8 characters
    -i        Use Argon2i (this is the default)
    -d        Use Argon2d instead of Argon2i
    -id        Use Argon2id instead of Argon2i
    -t N        Sets the number of iterations to N (default = 3)
    -m N        Sets the memory usage of 2^N KiB (default 12)
    -k N        Sets the memory usage of N KiB (default 4096)
    -p N        Sets parallelism to N threads (default 1)
    -l N        Sets hash output length to N bytes (default 32)
    -e        Output only encoded hash
    -r        Output only the raw bytes of the hash
    -v (10|13)    Argon2 version (defaults to the most recent version, currently 13)
    -h        Print argon2 usage
```
